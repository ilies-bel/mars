# Failure signature

A human-readable technical key identifying a class of orchestrator failure (e.g. `verify:has-diff/no-commits-ahead`, `merge:dirty-target`, `setup:install-failed`); composed from the `failingStep` and a normalized error class so the same root cause produces the same signature across runs. The unit a recovery recipe binds to.

_Avoid_: failure hash, error fingerprint
